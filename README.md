# Written in the Stars: An Astrological Social App
December 2020

<h3>About</h3>

Trello: https://trello.com/b/x0DLuoEy/unit-2-project-astro-dating-app

This is a simple, bare-bones social app, centered around astrology. Originally conceptualized as a dating app, the app features an open chat room and a sign-raiting system to encourage social interaction and discussion around all things astrology.

Users will log in using their Google account (OAuth). The user can update their personal profile with a status and their sun, moon, ascendent signs, if they know them. Moon and ascendent signs are not necessary to include at this time in order to get full app functionality. A sun sign is required (all signs and their corresponding dates are listed on the home page) in order to be matched with other users of compatible signs. 

Using the rating system, users can leave anonymous reviews of the signs, including a comment and a number score (1-5).

Using the message board, users can create threads of varying (hopefully astrology-based) topics, where other users can interact by commenting on the thread.
